# Solarized theme for sddm

**NOTE: This is alpha state theme, everything can happen if you try it**

This theme is based on Numix sddm theme
([https://github.com/intialonso/intialonso.github.io/tree/master/themes/sddm/numix](https://github.com/intialonso/intialonso.github.io/tree/master/themes/sddm/numix))
by Inti Alonso.  As in Numix theme, the wallpaper was generated using the tool:
[http://matthew.wagerfield.com/flat-surface-shader/](http://matthew.wagerfield.com/flat-surface-shader/)
by Matthew Wagerfield and Tobias van Schneider. It also uses some icons from
Numix icon theme [https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme)
(shutdown, reboot, warning and down arrow icons).  
QML files contain license headers.

## Aim
The aim of this theme is to display a simple yet complete sddm greeter based in
solarized palette by Ethan Schoonover
([http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)).  
I use this colors almost everywhere so, why not in the greeter? ;)

## Dependencies
This theme relies in `Raleway` and `Fontawesome` fonts. If you try this, make sure
that they are installed in your system.
