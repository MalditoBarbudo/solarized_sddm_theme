# Solarized theme for sddm

This theme is based on Numix sddm theme
([https://github.com/intialonso/intialonso.github.io/tree/master/themes/sddm/numix](https://github.com/intialonso/intialonso.github.io/tree/master/themes/sddm/numix))

## Aim
The aim of this theme is to display a simple yet complete sddm greeter based in
solarized palette by Ethan Schoonover
([http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)).  
I use this colors almost everywhere so, why not in the greeter? ;)
